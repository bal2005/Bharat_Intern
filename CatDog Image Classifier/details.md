# Dogs vs Cats Classification with Convolutional Neural Network

This project aims to classify images of dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Dogs vs Cats" dataset, which can be found on Kaggle: [Dogs vs Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). The dataset consists of labeled images of dogs and cats for training and testing the classification model.

### Kaggle API Setup

To download the dataset using the Kaggle API, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a Kaggle account and API key.
2. Create a Kaggle directory in your home folder and copy your Kaggle API key file (`kaggle.json`) to this directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
